# Directional Forecasting of Weekly Stock Returns

This repository contains the code and data used in the paper:

**"Directional Forecasting of Weekly Stock Returns: Revisiting Market Efficiency with Deep Neural Networks"**  
by Sang-Hyeok Lee (Korea Maritime Institute)

## üìö Abstract

This study reformulates short-horizon return forecasting as a binary classification problem. Using deep neural networks, we predict whether the average return of the next week exceeds that of the current week. Our best model (MLP) achieved a test accuracy of **71.62%**, statistically significant and economically meaningful.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `data/`: Includes raw and processed S&P 500 datasets
- `src/`: Model definitions, training logic, evaluation, and trading strategy simulation
- `notebook/`: Exploratory data analysis
- `results/`: Figures and metrics from empirical evaluation
- `paper/`: PDF copy of the published manuscript

## üîç Methods

- **Modeling**: 48 DNN variants (MLP, FCN, ResNet)
- **Validation**: Accuracy, F1-score, binomial tests, rolling-window stability
- **Economics**: Cumulative Return, Sharpe Ratio, and VaR via 4 trading strategies

Once you click **Rename**, your website will automatically be published at: https://your-username.github.io/. The HTML file‚Äîcalled `index.html`‚Äîis rendered as the home page and you'll be making changes to this file in the next step.

Congratulations! You just launched your first GitHub Pages website. It's now live to share with the entire world

## Making your first edit

When you make any change to any file in your project, you‚Äôre making a **commit**. If you fix a typo, update a filename, or edit your code, you can add it to GitHub as a commit. Your commits represent your project‚Äôs entire history‚Äîand they‚Äôre all saved in your project‚Äôs repository.

With each commit, you have the opportunity to write a **commit message**, a short, meaningful comment describing the change you‚Äôre making to a file. So you always know exactly what changed, no matter when you return to a commit.

## Practice: Customize your first GitHub website by writing HTML code

Want to edit the site you just published? Let‚Äôs practice commits by introducing yourself in your `index.html` file. Don‚Äôt worry about getting it right the first time‚Äîyou can always build on your introduction later.

Let‚Äôs start with this template:

```
<p>Hello World! I‚Äôm [username]. This is my website!</p>
```

To add your introduction, copy our template and click the edit pencil icon at the top right hand corner of the `index.html` file.

<img width="997" alt="edit-this-file" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18093541/63131820-0794d880-bf8d-11e9-8b3d-c096355e9389.png">


Delete this placeholder line:

```
<p>Welcome to your first GitHub Pages website!</p>
```

Then, paste the template to line 15 and fill in the blanks.

When you‚Äôre done, scroll down to the `Commit changes` section near the bottom of the edit page. Add a short message explaining your change, like "Add my introduction", then click `Commit changes`.

Once you click `Commit changes`, your changes will automatically be published on your GitHub Pages website. Refresh the page to see your new changes live in action.

:tada: You just made your first commit! :tada:

## Extra Credit: Keep on building!

Change the placeholder Octocat gif on your GitHub Pages website by [creating your own personal Octocat emoji](https://myoctocat.com/build-your-octocat/) or [choose a different Octocat gif from our logo library here](https://octodex.github.com/). Add that image to line 12 of your `index.html` file, in place of the `<img src=` link.
